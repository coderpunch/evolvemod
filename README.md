### Introduction

The original author ([Overv](https://code.google.com/p/evolvemod/)) has discontinued support of Evolve. I am currently continuing the development of this addon for GMod13. If you encounter any problems, please write an issue.

### How do I become owner?

If you're running a listen server, you're always owner. If you're running a dedicated server, join your server and type the following in the dedicated server console:
```
	ev rank yourname owner
```
### How do I make people admin or super admin?

Either...
Type in chat: `!rank playername admin/superadmin`

Use the menu: `Select player -> Administration -> Rank -> Admin/Super Admin`

Use the dedicated server console: `ev rank playername admin/superadmin`

The following ranks are available: `guest`, `respected`, `admin`, `superadmin` and `owner`. Note that people with the rank owner can only be demoted using the console and people can only be promoted to owner using the console. You can see the console as owner+ if you want.

## How do I open the menu?

Just bind a key to `+ev_menu`. Note that this will likely change in the future, so keep watching this file!
